# What's Next for You?

First off, congrats on making it to the final day! Your reward is an email with no code in it. Exciting, right?

There are quite a few topics we'd like to briefly touch upon to get your gears turning on what to do next. We'll stray away from the specific technical implementations and talk general ideas.

Without further ado, here's your Top 10 list of "Ways to Test Better":

1. Know that you are not limited to a single browser when testing. Pass in [an array of browsers](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio/blob/master/examples/wdio.conf.js#L71) in your `desiredCapabilities` configuration and WebdriverIO will run your tests in each browser.
2. WebdriverIO has [built in support](http://webdriver.io/guide/testrunner/cloudservices.html) for Selenium cloud tools like [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/) and [Browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com/). These services are great for testing in a multitude of browsers, and provide consistency when snapping screenshots through WebdriverCSS.
3. Automation and Continuous Integration go hand in hand. [Getting hooked in to a tool like Jenkins](http://webdriver.io/guide/testrunner/jenkins.html) or TravisCI is a great next step in improving the value of your tests.
4. Sometimes you just need to see how someone else did it. The WebdriverIO code repo contains [several examples to browse through](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio/tree/master/examples).
5. Get your tests organized by using a test framework like [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) or [Jasmine](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine). These frameworks make working with large test suites a breeze, and offer a deep set of features.
6. Once you start building out several test files, you'll end up with that same WebdriverIO configuration scattered across all of them. Switch over to using [the WebdriverIO Test Runner](http://webdriver.io/guide/testrunner/gettingstarted.html) to simplify your test setup.
7. Get your team on board with Visual Regression Testing by bribing them with cookies and donuts.
8. Need more help? The [WebdriverIO](https://gitter.im/webdriverio/webdriverio) and [WebdriverCSS](https://gitter.im/webdriverio/webdrivercss) chat rooms are open at all hours for questions and help with the journey. Reach out to @micahgodbolt and @klamping to let us know you've joined the fun.
