The content for this book is from http://learn.visualregressiontesting.com. It is a 6-day email course available for anyone interested in Visual Regression Testing.

Throughout this book, you'll notice mentions of the current day in the course (e.g. "It's Day 1!"), or references to previous/later days. This is due to the nature of the original content.

Each chapter in this book matches a day in the course. So six chapters is equal to six days.

With that said, let's get started!
